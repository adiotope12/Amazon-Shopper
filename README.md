# Amazon-Shopper
This is a program I created using the Selenium Webdriver that takes in items to shop on Amazon.
## Process
1. Takes in user inputs.
2. Takes user to the Amazon sign in page.
3. Once signed in, the program starts to search and add each item to cart.
4. Once finished adding items, the program takes the user to the cart and ends.
